# TreasureHunting_RL
For this project, I implemented the Reinforcement Q-learning algorithm to help a hunter go through a maze of walls and bandits to find the optimal path to the treasure. I created 2 different reward systems to see how the policy created changes depepending on the rewards. Check out my notebook to learn more about Reinforcement Q-learning and my implementaion.
